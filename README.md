# YouTubeHaiku

Welcome! YouTubeHaiku (more formally known as r/youtubehaiku) is a subsection of reddit.com (a subreddit) devoted to short YouTube videos that are "somewhat poetic" and shorter than an arbitrary 14 seconds. 

My script (written in Python) will make use of the Reddit and YouTube APIs to scrape the top 25 links from r/youtubehaiku every day and automatically make them into a YouTube playlist for my own bingeing pleasure.
